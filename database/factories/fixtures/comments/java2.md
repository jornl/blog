Java's string concatenation is straightforward, but keep in mind the efficiency when working with large strings. Use
StringBuilder for better performance:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.append("Hello");
sb.append(" World");
System.out.println(sb.toString());  // Output: Hello World
```

In this example, we used a StringBuilder to concatenate two strings efficiently.
