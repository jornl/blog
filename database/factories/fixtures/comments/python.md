Great introduction to Python! If you're just starting out, don't forget to explore Python's built-in functions. For
example, you can quickly find the length of a string using:

```python
string = "Hello, World!"
length = len(string)
print(length)  # Output: 13
```

This will return 13, which is the number of characters in the string. Have fun coding in Python!
