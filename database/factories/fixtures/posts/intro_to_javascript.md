# Getting Started with JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web
browsers. It is an essential language for web development, allowing you to add dynamic behavior to your web pages.

## Setting Up Your JavaScript Environment

JavaScript doesn't require any special setup to start coding. All you need is a web browser and a text editor. You can
write JavaScript directly within an HTML file or in a separate `.js` file.

## Writing Your First JavaScript Program

Let's start with a simple JavaScript program that displays "Hello, World!" in the browser console. Create an HTML file
named `index.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
    console.log("Hello, World!");
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Open the index.html file in your browser and open the developer tools (usually by pressing F12). You should see the
message "Hello, World!" in the console.

## Understanding the Code

The `<script>` tag is used to include JavaScript code within an HTML file.

`console.log("Hello, World!");` is a JavaScript statement that prints "Hello, World!" to the browser's console.

## What's Next?

Next, we'll explore how to manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript, introducing you to the Document Object Model
(DOM).
