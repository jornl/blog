# Learning PHP

## Introduction

PHP is a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is widely used to build dynamic and
interactive websites.

## Sample Code

Let's write a simple PHP script that prints "Hello, World!" to the browser.

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

Save this code in a file named `hello.php` and run it on a web server. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed in your
browser.

## Understanding the Code

- `<?php ... ?>` is the PHP opening and closing tag that delimits the PHP code.
- `echo "Hello, World!";` is a PHP statement that outputs the string "Hello, World!" to the browser.
- PHP statements end with a semicolon `;`.
- PHP code is executed on the server before the HTML is sent to the client's browser.
- PHP files typically have a `.php` extension.
- PHP can be embedded within HTML code to create dynamic web pages.
- PHP is easy to learn and offers powerful features for web development.
