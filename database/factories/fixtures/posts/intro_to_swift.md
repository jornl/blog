# Getting Started with Swift

## What is Swift?

Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language developed by Apple for building iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS
applications. It is designed to be easy to learn and safe to use, with modern features that make coding fun and
productive.

## Setting Up Your Swift Environment

To start coding in Swift, you'll need a Mac with Xcode installed. Xcode is Apple's integrated development environment (
IDE) for Swift and can be downloaded from the Mac App Store. Once installed, you can use Xcode's built-in playgrounds to
experiment with Swift code.

## Writing Your First Swift Program

Let's write a simple Swift program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Open Xcode and create a new playground,
then add the following code:

```swift
import Foundation

print("Hello, World!")
```

Run the playground, and you should see "Hello, World!" printed in the console output. Congratulations, you've written
your first Swift program!

## Understanding the code

- `import Foundation` imports the Foundation framework, which provides essential functionality for Swift programs.
- `print("Hello, World!")` prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console output.

## What's Next?

Next, we'll explore Swift's unique features like optionals, closures, and its powerful type system.
