# Getting Started with Go

## What is Go?

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language created by Google. It is designed for simplicity,
efficiency, and scalability, making it ideal for developing large-scale, high-performance applications. Go is
particularly well-suited for building web servers and concurrent systems.

## Setting Up Your Go Environment

To start coding in Go, you'll need to install the Go programming language from
the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/). After installation, verify it by typing the following command in your
terminal or command prompt:

```bash
go version
```

This should display the installed Go version. You can also set up your Go workspace by defining the `GOPATH` environment
variable.

## Writing Your First Go Program

Let's write a simple Go program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Create a new file named `main.go` and add
the following code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

To run the program, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your main.go file is located,
and type:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Understanding the Code

- `package main` declares the package for the program. Every Go application starts with a main package.
- `import "fmt"` imports the fmt package, which provides I/O functions like Println.
- `func main()` defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program.
- `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")` prints the string "Hello, World!" followed by a new line.

## What's Next?

Next, we'll explore Go's concurrency model, error handling, and standard library to build more complex applications.
