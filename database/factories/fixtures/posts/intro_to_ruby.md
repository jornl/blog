# Getting Started with Ruby

## What is Ruby?

Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant
syntax that is natural to read and easy to write, making it a popular choice for web development, especially with the
Ruby on Rails framework.

## Setting Up Your Ruby Environment

To start coding in Ruby, you need to have Ruby installed on your computer. You can download it from
the [official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). After installation, verify it by typing the
following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
ruby --version
```

This should display the installed Ruby version. You can also use the interactive Ruby shell by typing `irb` in your
terminal.

## Writing Your First Ruby Program

Let's write a simple Ruby program that prints `"Hello, World!"` to the console.

Create a new file named `hello.rb` and add the following code:

```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

To run the program, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your `hello.rb` file is
located, and type:

```bash
ruby hello.rb
```

You should see the output:

```bash
Hello, World!
```

## Understanding the Code

`puts` is a method in Ruby that prints a string to the console followed by a new line.
`"Hello, World!"` is a string, a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
